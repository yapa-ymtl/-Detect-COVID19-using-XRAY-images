# Detect-COVID19-using-XRAY-images
5&amp;6th Semester Data Management project 

This is a **CNN** (Convolution Neural Network) model that developed for detect **COVID-19** using chest XRAY images. For the deep learning model **ResNet50** is used and the model could able to get an accuracy of **95.58%**. This model also possible to detect Pneumonia.
